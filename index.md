   1. **MATH 407, Probability Theory, *Prof. J. Fulman***
   
      There are 38 lecture notes, but the final only covers 1 through 19. There are some practice problems after lecture 19.

   2. **MATH 430, Number Theory, *Prof. P. Tokorcheck***
   
      Professor Paul Tokorcheck taught this class in a very good fashion. Although "Number Theory" sounds intimidating, but it is not. The course content, though abstract, was greatly demonstrated and proved by the instructor. He was also kind enough to write a recommendation letter for the Continuing Students Scholarship.

      Note: This class has no official lecture notes, but one good way to refer to the content is through the textbook.

Credit to Qilin Ye (yeqilin@usc.edu). His website: https://yql-skorpion.github.io/.

He possesses great skills of using LaTeX, using which he wrote all of his math course notes that are extremely visual appealing. (You are probably gonna love math because of his notes!) He also includes the LaTeX configurations in his home page.
